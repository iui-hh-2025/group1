		<p>Before AI entered the scene, music recommendations came in many forms.</p>
		<p><b>The Mixtape : 1970s and 1980s</b></p>
		<p>With the use of cassette tapes, curating a mixtape was a work of art. Often time consuming to make, mixtapes offered a unique selecton and order to songs that allowed users to make a creative statement. Some might say that mixtapes were the first evolution for music recommendations.</p>
		<p><b>The CD Era : 1990s and Early 2000s</b></p>
		<p>The accessibility of CDs catapulted the art of creating a mixtape and made sharing music with others that much easier. No car ride was ever the same!</p>
		<p><b>The Digital Movement : Mid 2000s - Present</b></p>
		<p>iTunes hit the scene in 2001 and opened up a new level of convenience for users. Following shortly after in the same year, the first iPod hit the shelves and change the music game forever. You no longer had to burn a CD in order to listen to the music you wanted, it was all right there in one small box.</p>
