				<h2>The History of Music Discovery</h2>
				<p>Before AI entered the scene, music recommendations came in many forms, each reflecting the technology and culture of its time.</p>
				
				<div class="feature-card">
					<h3>The Mixtape Era: 1970s and 1980s</h3>
					<p>Music recommendations began in 1964 with homemade cassette tapes—also known as mixtapes—as people created tracks intended for themselves, family, and friends to listen to at home and on the go; they also acted as demos for original works.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup></p>
					<p>With the use of cassette tapes, curating a mixtape was a work of art. Often time-consuming to make and limited by their format and sixty-to-ninety minute capacity, creators had to carefully select, order, record, and edit songs to meet these constraints while offering a unique perspective, telling a story, or making a creative statement.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></p>
				</div>

				<div class="feature-card">
					<h3>The CD Era: 1990s and Early 2000s</h3>
					<p>In 1982, the compact disc (CD) was made available to the public and quickly became the most popular form of storing music—and recommending it.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> The accessibility and versatility of CDs catapulted the art of creating a mixtape and made sharing music with others easier than before.</p>
					<p>By 2000, the CD accounted for 92.3% of the entire market share in regard to US music sales.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup></p>
				</div>

				<div class="feature-card">
					<h3>The Digital Movement: Early 2000s – Present</h3>
					<p>Rhapsody (Napster), iTunes, and iPods hit the scene and opened up a new level of convenience for users.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> People no longer had to burn music onto CDs in order to listen to a curation of their favorite songs—nor did they have to purchase those songs. Instead, people controlled one device to listen to any song they had purchased or downloaded, in order or on shuffle mode.</p>
					<p>In 2005, Pandora introduced algorithms to the playlist, curating personalized radios based off listeners' preferences.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> This emerging technology continued and evolved into a new form in the present used by on-demand music streaming services, where artificial intelligence uses users' previous listening histories, current trends, noted favorites, and other shared metadata to auto-curate playlists and radios for users' immediate enjoyment.</p>
