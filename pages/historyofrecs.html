		<p>Before AI entered the scene, music recommendations came in many forms.</p>
		<p><b>The Mixtape : 1970s and 1980s</b></p>
		<p>Music recommendations began in 1964 with homemade cassette tapes&mdash;also known as mixtapes&mdash;as people created tracks intended for themselves, family, and friends to listen to at home and on the go; they also acted as demos for original works.<ref>Boakye, J. (n.d.). &ldquo;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/369hlkwBM4xT5DjWP3yNRct/a-brief-history-of-the-playlist BBC Radio 4 - Add to Playlist - a Brief History of the Playlist.]&rdquo; BBC; The British Broadcasting Corporation.</ref><ref>Mendiola, O. (2023, August 9). &ldquo;[https://www.wired.com/story/history-of-mixtapes-future/ How Mixtapes Remixed Music History&ndash;And Its Future.]&rdquo; <i>Wired</i>; Cond√© Nast.</ref> With the use of cassette tapes, curating a mixtape was a work of art. Often time-consuming to make and limited by their format and sixty-to-ninety minute capacity, creators had to carefully select, order, record, and edit songs to meet these constaints while offering a unique perspective, telling a story, or making a creative statement.<ref>Johnson, N. (2016, August 16) &ldquo;[https://www.medium.com/applaudience/what-about-the-end-the-evolution-of-the-playlist-5261fb8b7555 What about the End? : The Evolution from Mixtape to Playlist.]&rdquo; Applaudience; Medium.</ref></p>
		<p><b>The CD Era : 1990s and Early 2000s</b></p>
		<p>In 1982, the compact disc (CD) was made available to the public and quickly became the most popular form of storing music&mdash;and recommending it.<ref>Boakye, J. (n.d.). &ldquo;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/369hlkwBM4xT5DjWP3yNRct/a-brief-history-of-the-playlist BBC Radio 4 - Add to Playlist - a Brief History of the Playlist.]&rdquo; BBC; The British Broadcasting Corporation.</ref>The accessibility and versatility of CDs catapulted the art of creating a mixtape and made sharing music with others easier than before. <-- No car ride was ever the same! --></p>
		<p><b>The Digital Movement : Early 2000s &ndash; Present</b></p>
		<p>Rhapsody (Napster), iTunes, and iPods hit the scene and shelves in 2001 and opened up a new level of convenience for users.<ref>Boakye, J. (n.d.). &ldquo;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/369hlkwBM4xT5DjWP3yNRct/a-brief-history-of-the-playlist BBC Radio 4 - Add to Playlist - a Brief History of the Playlist.]&rdquo; BBC; The British Broadcasting Corporation.</ref> People no longer had to burn music onto CDs in order to listen to a curation of their favorite songs&mdash;nor did they have to purchase those songs. Instead, people controlled one device to listen to any song they had purchased or downloaded, in order or on shuffle mode; they could create their own playlists quickly and efficiently on their own device or at home to sync up later and burn CDs for their friends to add to their own music libraries.</p>
		<p>In 2005, Pandora introduced algorithms to the playlist, curating personalized radios based off listeners' preferences.<ref>Boakye, J. (n.d.). &ldquo;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/369hlkwBM4xT5DjWP3yNRct/a-brief-history-of-the-playlist BBC Radio 4 - Add to Playlist - a Brief History of the Playlist.]&rdquo; BBC; The British Broadcasting Corporation.</ref> This emerging technology continued and evolved to a new form in the present used by on-demand music streaming services, where artificial intelligemce uses users' previous listening histories, current trends, noted favorites, and other shared metadata to auto-curate playlists and radios for users' immediate enjoyment.</p>
