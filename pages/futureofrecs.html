		<p>How will AI change how music is listened to in the future? [Continue intro text. pulling from new kinds of data, out of both desire for innovation and (in some cases) necessity]</p>

		<p>[Reference studies- looking at facial expressions, recommendations based on emotion. Currently in the hypothetical but studies are already laying the groundwork]</p>

		<p>[Other issue on horizon- consolidation of music vendors using proprietary datasets. Data walled off limits possibilities for innovation outside megacorps, but also leads to new approaches. Reference AMRM and its focus on small datasets]</p>

		<p>AI's future in music recommendation is that of two paths. Studies are pursuing new avenues in data collection and model accuracyâ€“ but also having to reinvent the foundations of data modeling itself to make progress when conventional resources are unavailable to them. As such, approaches to AI in music recommendations are likely to diversify, at least temporarily, as research efforts both large and small attempt to find the next new well of information to draw from. Whether these will show promise is less certain as the limits of AI are currently being tested, but for now the research will continue in these directions, casting the future of music recommendations in excitement and uncertainty alike.</p>
